## Approach Strategy

### Recommended Introduction Path

**Priority 1: Keiretsu Forum Coordination**
- Coordinate with Anamaria Meshkurti outreach
- If Meshkurti responds positively, she could facilitate introduction to Elvhage
- Position as "Keiretsu Forum deal flow" rather than cold outreach
- **Timing:** After initial Meshkurti relationship established

**Priority 2: Mutual LinkedIn Connections**
- Research mutual connections between Alexander and Elvhage
- Look for Stockholm tech ecosystem players, EBAN members

**Priority 3: Stockholm Business Angels Network**
- Research if any STOAF members are accessible

**Priority 4: Investpodden.se Engagement**
- Listen to recent episodes for current focus areas
- Potential: Pitch LetheAI story for podcast feature

### Pitch Positioning

**Lead with:**
1. **Software/AI Heritage Recognition** - Acknowledge his 20+ years in software investing
2. **Keiretsu Forum Deal Flow** - Position as strong potential for Forum presentation
3. **European AI Sovereignty** - Align with his European tech ecosystem advocacy
4. **Nordic Expansion Potential** - Geneva base but Nordic market opportunity

**Ask (Tiered):**
1. Initial: Exploratory conversation, feedback on pitch
2. Near-term: Introduction to Keiretsu Forum Nordics deal review process
3. Medium-term: Personal angel investment €25K-€50K + facilitate syndication
4. Value-add: Strategic advisory on Nordic market entry

### Dual-Track Strategy with Meshkurti

**Coordinated Keiretsu Forum Approach:**
- Both Elvhage (Nordics co-founder) and Meshkurti (member) in same network
- Could present as "Keiretsu Forum cross-chapter opportunity" (Geneva/Nordics)
- Elvhage brings Nordic angel community, Meshkurti brings Swiss gov connections
- Positions LetheAI as pan-European play

**Timing:**
- Meshkurti first (Swiss proximity, clearer AI/blockchain focus)
- Elvhage second (coordinate through Keiretsu Forum connection)
- Joint presentation to Keiretsu Forum: Q2 2026 target

## Investment Capacity Assessment

### Personal Angel Capacity
- **Through Stockholm Business Angels:** €25K-€100K range
- **Through Keiretsu Forum Nordics:** Could lead or participate in larger syndications
- **Individual capacity:** Likely €50K-€100K based on track record

### Syndication Potential
- **Stockholm Business Angels:** Could organize €200K-€500K round
- **Keiretsu Forum Nordics:** Could organize €500K-€1M+ through Chapter
- **EBAN Network:** Pan-European angel syndication for larger rounds
- **Combined networks:** €1M-€2M potential through coordinated approach

### Strategic vs. Financial
- Primary value: **Network access and syndication facilitation**

## Key Strategic Insight

Elvhage is best approached as a **syndication facilitator** rather than a lead investor, given his current aerospace focus. However, his historical software investment background (20+ years) and senior roles in both Keiretsu Forum Nordics and Stockholm Business Angels make him potentially the **highest-leverage angel network contact** on the entire prospect list.

**Coordinated Approach Opportunity:** The Elvhage + Meshkurti connection through Keiretsu Forum creates a unique opportunity for a **dual-champion strategy** within the global Keiretsu network, potentially unlocking both Swiss government connections (Meshkurti) and Nordic ecosystem access (Elvhage) simultaneously.
