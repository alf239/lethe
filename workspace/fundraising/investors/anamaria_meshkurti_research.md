- Comfortable with pre-revenue to early traction companies

✅ **Angel Network Leverage**
- Keiretsu Forum membership enables syndication
- Can organize larger rounds through network
- Reduces fundraising complexity

✅ **Geographic Synergy**

### Potential Concerns

⚠️ **Geographic Distance**

- **Mitigation:** Strong Geneva network remains, remote involvement normal post-COVID

⚠️ **Check Size Clarity**
- Personal investment size (~$10K) relatively modest
- AMVS Capital structure and deployment timeline unclear
