## Personal Story & Motivation

From his LinkedIn post (Aug 2023):
> "10 years ago, I had my dream job and instead of being grateful, I was desperately unhappy. I was a prop trader in Switzerland earning more money than most people my age... Then one day I visited my friend Usman Khan at his new fintech startup. The energy of the office, the people and their success in that moment flowed through me. There was no turning back."

- Started as algorithmic trader with "dream job" but felt unfulfilled
- Inspired by startup energy and purpose
- Initially founded Cognism as Fintech (alternative to Reuters)
- Pivoted to sales intelligence platform

**Philosophy:** Numbers-driven management approach, strong focus on outbound sales, hiring best talent

**Notable goal (Jan 2024):** "It's my goal to have our first salesperson earn over $1M this year" - shows commitment to team success and aggressive growth targets
