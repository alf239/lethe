## 1. Anamaria Meshkurti - LinkedIn Connection Request

**Subject**: Geneva AI entrepreneur seeking InnoSuisse guidance

**Message** (300 char limit):
```
Hi Anamaria,

I'm building LetheAI, an autonomous AI agent platform in Geneva. Noticed your InnoSuisse expertise - with the April BRIDGE deadline approaching, would love your perspective on government AI funding for startups.

Worth a brief chat?

Alexander
```

**Alternative (if mutual connection exists):**
```
Hi Anamaria,

[Mutual connection] suggested I reach out. Building autonomous AI agents in Geneva, interested in your InnoSuisse experience. April BRIDGE deadline has my attention!

Coffee in Geneva?

Alexander
```

**Follow-up message after acceptance:**
```
Thanks for connecting! 

Quick context: LetheAI is autonomous AI agents for complex workflows (think beyond chatbots - agents that can research, write code, manage projects). I'm final-year biomedical PhD at [university] + blockchain architect.

With InnoSuisse BRIDGE deadline April 28, I'm evaluating Swiss government funding paths. Your government tech background + Keiretsu Forum perspective would be incredibly valuable.

Would you have 20-30 min for a call in the next 2 weeks? Happy to work around your schedule.

Best,
Alexander
```

## 2. James Isilay - LinkedIn Connection Request

**Subject**: Biomedical PhD + healthcare AI compliance

**Message** (300 char limit):
```
Hi James,

Biomedical PhD + AI entrepreneur in Zürich. Your healthcare AI compliance expertise caught my eye - FDA's 2025 enforcement shift makes governance critical.

Would love to discuss LetheAI's approach. Brief call?

Alexander
```

**Alternative (emphasize PhD background):**
```
Hi James,

Final-year biomedical PhD building autonomous AI agents. Your healthcare/compliance background is fascinating - especially with new FDA frameworks.

Could I get your take on AI governance? Coffee in Zürich?

Alexander
```

**Follow-up message after acceptance:**
```
Thanks James!

Context: LetheAI builds autonomous AI agents (beyond simple chatbots). I'm wrapping up biomedical sciences PhD while building this + working as blockchain architect.

Healthcare AI is a natural application area, but compliance complexity is real. Your work on diagnostic AI + regulatory frameworks is exactly the expertise I need input from.

Specifically interested in:
- Swiss healthcare AI regulatory landscape (Zürich Innovation Sandbox)
- Building trust in AI systems for healthcare
- Governance frameworks for responsible AI deployment

Would 20-30 min call work in next 2-3 weeks?

Best,
Alexander
```

**Subject**: Deep tech AI + Nordic angel investment

**Message** (300 char limit):
```
Hi Ted,

Loved your recent sTARTUp Day interview on deep tech investing. Building autonomous AI agents (LetheAI) - interested in Stockholm Business Angels / Keiretsu Forum Nordics.

**Alternative (if Meshkurti connection exists):**
```
Hi Ted,

Anamaria Meshkurti (Keiretsu Forum) suggested I reach out. Building autonomous AI agents, interested in your perspective on Stockholm Business Angels + Keiretsu Forum Nordics.

**Follow-up message after acceptance:**
```
Thanks for connecting Ted!

Really appreciated your January interview on deep tech + European innovation potential - aligns perfectly with what I'm building.

LetheAI: Autonomous AI agents for complex workflows (research, code, project management). Think "AI teammates" not chatbots. I'm final-year biomedical PhD + blockchain architect, based in Geneva but thinking Nordic expansion.

Your Stockholm Business Angels + Keiretsu Forum Nordics network is intriguing - 45+ portfolio companies suggests you've seen a lot. Would love 20-30 min to:
- Get your take on LetheAI's fit for angel/syndicate investment
- Understand Nordic market potential
- Discuss Keiretsu Forum presentation process

Available for call in February?

Best,
Alexander

## Message Customization Notes

**Before sending, Alexander should:**
1. Replace [university] with actual institution
2. Check for mutual connections on each profile
3. Adjust tone based on relationship warmth (formal vs casual)
4. Add specific technical details if relevant to conversation
5. Update timing (e.g., "February" → specific date ranges)

**Response to common questions:**

**"Tell me more about LetheAI"**
```
LetheAI builds autonomous AI agents that handle complex multi-step workflows. Unlike chatbots (reactive Q&A), our agents proactively:
- Research and synthesize information
- Write and execute code
- Manage long-running projects
- Coordinate with humans and other agents

Think "AI teammate" rather than "AI assistant". Target: knowledge workers drowning in complexity.

Current traction: [Alexander fills in]
Team: [Alexander fills in]
Funding stage: Pre-seed / angel round
```

**"What's your background?"**
```
- Final-year PhD in biomedical sciences (COVID modeling)
- Blockchain architect at Alien (SF-based, remote from Geneva)
- 20+ years software/systems experience
- Interested in AI, physics, complex systems
```

**"What kind of investment are you raising?"**
```
Currently talking to angels for pre-seed round:
- Target: €500K-€1M
- Use: Team expansion, product development, Swiss/EU market traction
- Timeline: Q1-Q2 2026
- Strategic investors preferred (expertise + capital)
```
